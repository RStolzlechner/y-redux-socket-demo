# y-redux-socket-demo
This sample demonstrates the implementation of a concept known as Y-Redux-Socket. The aim of this concept is to enhance code maintainability for collaborative web applications, focusing on client-server communication using the WebSocket protocol and client-side state management. Further details about the concept are available in the Y-Redux-Socket bachelor thesis, which can be accessed here:  [YReduxSocket bachelor thesis](./YReduxSocket-bachelor-thesis.pdf) (in German).
